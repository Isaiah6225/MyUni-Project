# MyUni-Project
This project is for the Shaw Software Engineering class. The repo serves as a storage method for the "MyUni" application. The app functions as a social media app to connect students with other students at their university. The app will allow students to create groups and clubs via the app and, in addition, allow for students to find clubs and events.
